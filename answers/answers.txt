Directions: Write a query that returns the following collumns:

Pokemon Name	Trainer Name	Level	Primary Type	Secondary Type
Pokemon's name	Trainer's name	Current Level	Primary Type Name	Secondary Type Name

Sort the data by finding out which trainer has the strongest pokemon so that this will act as a ranking of strongest
 to weakest trainer. You may interpret strongest in whatever way you want, but you will have to explain your decision.
leave a comment explaining how your query is deciding who the strongest trainer is
